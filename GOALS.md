## Types

- Framework fully typed.
- Apps fully typed.
- Minimal types written by app developers.

## Performance

Most everything is implemented using functions and closures, which are super fast and heavily optimized by browsers.

## Simplicity

A new comer should be able to learn the framework and get up and running in less than a day. To achieve that, we need to minimize the amount of concepts that users have to learn.

For example components are just functions, and props are just arguments to those functions. If one knows how to write types for function arguments, that's enough.

## Platform agnostic

The framework has zero knowledge about the DOM. This makes it easier to run in nodejs without much headache. Also, tests don't require any special setup.

## Code size

The aim is to create a powerful, modern, reactive framework that's blazing fast, but also tiny in size. But that's not enough. It's also important to design the framework in a way that makes it possible to write complex apps with minimal code.
